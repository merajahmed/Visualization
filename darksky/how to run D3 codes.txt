For any codes that are made by HTLM5 and Javascript, you will need a Browser to run the program. A server needs to be created to load  data and hander requests from the client (Browser). 

To build a local server on your own machine, the simplest way is to run the command "python -m http.server 8888" in the directory of your HTML5/Javascript files. Then, just visit "localhost:8888/index.html" in your Browser, and you will be directed to the index.html file in the directory of your HTML5/Javascript files. Here "8888" is the port number that the server listens to, and "index.html" is the web page that you want to visit.

Make sure you have installed python on your machine.
